### Problem

Given an unsorted array of integers, find a pair with given sum in it.

### Example

```
Input:

arr = [8, 7, 2, 5, 3, 1]
sum = 10

Output:

Pair found at index 0 and 2 (8 + 2)
or
Pair found at index 1 and 4 (7 + 3)
```

### Native Approach

Naive solution would be to consider every pair in given array and return if desired sum is found.
